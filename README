TIME Stories (http://www.spacecowboys.fr/time-stories) is an amazing game.
Great system, endless possibilities. The retail scenarios are great fun,
but the system encourages fan-made scenarios like few games do.

To facilitate the creation of such scenarios, this W.I.P. project aims
to provide an on-line scenario creation tool.

The components will be:
    - a REST API
    - a front-end website
    - possibly some mobile apps if some generous mobile devs chime in

The features:
    - Create/manipulate game objects (elements, locations, receptacles, ...)
        through dedicated views
    - See an overview of your scenario deck in a deck view, reorganize,
        zoom in on a card to edit, ...
    - The power of storing your card components in a database:
        Want to change the icon of one of your character abilities?
        -> No need to edit all your cards
    - Add meta-information on your cards:
        Card X (unlocks) -> State token Y (unlocks) -> Card Z
        Card X (skill test) -> Stat Y (3 Normal shields, 2 Skull shields, ...)
        -> This lets you navigate the interface following your game logic
        -> It also auto-adds the necessary icons to your cards,
            which you can then edit
    - Generate ready-to-print PDFs
    - Down the line, some helpful visualization:
        Stat X is used in N skill tests
        Easily see orphan elements / state tokens
        ...

The progress:
    - Model objects: 50%
        Generic card implementation done
        Next: Higher-level game objects (that rely on the Card object)
    - API handlers: 0%
        TODO
    - PDF generation: 0%
        TODO
    - Website front-end: 0%
        TODO
    - Mobile front-end: 0%

ETA for a proof-of-concept: January 2016
